MTU-Transfer-Course-Gatherer (This project):
    - Mozilla Public License Version 2.0

All code included in this repository was initially made for this repository,
no libraries or copied code are included.

Primary Licensing Choice Reasons:
    - Open Source
    - Malleable in usage
    - Allows distribution without becoming "infectious"
        - Essentially allows people to take bits and pieces of the work to be
          reused without worrying about licensing behind what was pulled. IE: A
          new frontend could be written without worry on disclosure on added
          components.
    - No annoyances with copying license notices in every file
