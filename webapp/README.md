This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running the app in development mode

First, copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and change the endpoint variable if necessary.

Then, run `npm start`.

## Building the app for production

Set the environment variables (in `.env.example`) in some way so that they will be available during the build.

Then, run `npm run build`. It will output artifacts to the `./build` directory.
